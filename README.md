My sites main goal is to show gym exercises. The exercises are deviden into muscle group and can be choosen by groups. 
When a user is logged he has the ability to add a workout to his library and that way to see all the exercises that he likes.
A video using the site is added in the files.

The site is written in php the database is made in MySql. I used WAMP server while compiling the site, a mysql file will be added for creating the database.

It needs some changes to be made i want the photos to be displayed better also there will be great to have a page to show more about a exercise like a longer description, a full size image or a dedicated video how the exercise is executed. But I will try to do them in the future.
